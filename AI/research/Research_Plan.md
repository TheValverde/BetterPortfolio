# AG-UI & Agno Research Plan

## üéØ **Research Objectives**

**Primary Goal**: Conduct comprehensive, evidence-based research on AG-UI and Agno frameworks to determine the optimal approach for implementing an intelligent AI agent in Hugo's portfolio.

**Research Questions**:
1. What is AG-UI exactly and what are its core capabilities?
2. What is Agno and how does it differ from other agent frameworks?
3. How can these technologies be embedded beyond simple chat interfaces?
4. What are the technical requirements and limitations?
5. How do they compare to alternatives like LangGraph?
